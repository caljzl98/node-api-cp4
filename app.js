    "summary": "Practicing meditation and mindfulness will make you at least 10 percent happier. \
    Being mindful doesnâ€™t change the problems in your life, but mindfulness does help you respond \
    to your problems rather than react to them. Mindfulness helps you realize that striving for \
    success is fine as long as you accept that the outcome is outside your control."

    than what you believe you can achieve and 2) you should take actions that are 10X greater than \
    what you believe are necessary to achieve your goals. The biggest mistake most people make in \
    life is not setting goals high enough. Taking massive action is the only way to fulfill your \
    true potential."

    thing of all is to learn to love the journey, not the destination. Get a real life rather than \
    frantically chasing the next level of success."

    "summary": "An idea occurs when you develop a new combination of old elements. The capacity to \
    bring old elements into new combinations depends largely on your ability to see relationships. \
    All ideas follow a five-step process of 1) gathering material, 2) intensely working over the \
    material in your mind, 3) stepping away from the problem, 4) allowing the idea to come back to \
    you naturally, and 5) testing your idea in the real world and adjusting it based on feedback."

    is weak. Know how to deceive the enemy: appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you \
    are weak. Know your strengths and weaknesses: if you know the enemy and know yourself, you \
    need not fear the result of a hundred battles."
